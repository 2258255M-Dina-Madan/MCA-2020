<h1>Week 5 - Standards in Curation</h1>

<h2>Task 1 - Schema of Metadata Elements for Describing Music</h2>

<p>Using the <a href="https://music-encoding.org/guidelines/v4/content/metadata.html">MEI Guidelines</a> I have collated a list of what I believe is the most important
metadata elements for describing music. The main categories I selected are file description and encoding description. File description includes elements such as 
title of file and music, composer, transcriber and edition statement. Whereas the encoding description includes project information.</p>

<ul>
  <li>File Description - describing the computer MEI file:<br>
  <ul>
      <li>Title Statement - title of file + sub-elements
        <ul>
            <li>Title of music piece</li>
            <li>Composer- who created it</li>
            <li>Responsibility Statement - who encoded the transcribed piece</li><br>
            </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Edition Statement - source of transcription + editorial activity
        <ul>
            <li>Edition</li>
            <li>date</li>
            <li>Revised by</li><br>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Extent - describing the physical size of the file</li><br>
        <li>Publication Statement
          <ul>
              <li>Publisher</li>
              <li>Publisher location including 'geoname' tag</li><br>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Encoding Description - methods in the ecoding and editing process:
    <ul>
        <li>Application software that has been used</li>
        <li>Project information</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  
<h2>Modifying my MEI file</h2>

<p>For the next task, I have modifyed my MEI file according to the schema that I have created above. Furthermore, I have enriched my data by linking to the existing 
authoritiy called <a href = "http://dbpedia.org/fct/facet.vsp">dbpedia.org.</a>To access my MEI file, please click
