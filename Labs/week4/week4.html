<h2>Generating a jSymbolic of my piece, 'Chura Liya Hai'</h2>

<p>Presented in a table are the features I chose to be analysed in my jSymbolic report, a short description about these features 
(according to the <a href="http://jmir.sourceforge.net/manuals/jSymbolic_manual/home.html">jSymbolic Manual</a>) & the values that were generated.
To access the extracted data in a CSV file, please click <a href="featurevalues.csv">here</a></p>
