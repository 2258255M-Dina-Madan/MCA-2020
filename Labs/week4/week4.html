<h2>Task 1 - Generating a jSymbolic of my piece, 'Chura Liya Hai'</h2>

<p>Presented in a table are the features I chose to be analysed in my jSymbolic report, a short description about these features 
(according to the <a href="http://jmir.sourceforge.net/manuals/jSymbolic_manual/home.html">jSymbolic Manual</a>) & the values that were generated.
To access the extracted data in a CSV file, please click <a href="featurevalues.csv">here</a></p>

<h2>Task 2.1 - Generating a Piano Roll</h2>
<p>On music21, I generated a piano roll of pitches throughout my piece. This graph can be seen below. 
The horizontal lines indicate time position and the veritcal lines indicate pitch.</p>

<h2>Task 2.2 - Generating a Pitch Histogram</h2>			     
<p>On music21, I generated a pitch histogram to analyse which pitches are used most and least throughout my piece.
From the graph below, it is clear that the most frequent pitch is between 60 and 70. This is consistent with the data
extracted from my jSymbolic report in task 1, which illustrates the most common pitch as 69.</p>
