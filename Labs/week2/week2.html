<h1>Week 2 task - Notation Basics</h1>

<p>The piece of music I transcribed is called, 'Chura Liya Hai.' It is from the 1973 Bollywood film "Yaadon Ki Barat". 
I picked this because it is beautifully sung by Asha Bhosle, the Indian playback singer. I utilised a YouTube video that is displayed below
to transbribe an instrumental version of the piece. I found this useful as it displayed both the audio recording and printed score</p>

<p>Below is my transcribed MuseScore file. It can also download it <a href="Chura Liya Hai.mscz">here.</a>
Please note, the score should be viewed in, 'continuous view' on MuseScore. The music sheet holds a lot of empty bars that 
I was unable to delete once I finished transcribing my 10+ bars. I have screenshotted my score, cropping out the empty bars.</p>
