<h2>Task 2.1 - Time Frequency Analysis VS Waveform Based Analysis</h2>
<p>A time frequency analysis is more advantageous than a waveform based analysis. A waveform is used to represent audio signal and displays changes in amplitude over time. 
As shown in the waveform graphs for ‘Harati Harati’ and ‘Awen’ the loudness of these pieces is mostly consistent and do not change over time.
‘Rain forest dreams,’ displays the most change in amplitude, but again it is not a lot. Although these music tracks are from different genres, the waveform graphs gives the indication 
 that these songs all exude similar feeling, which is quite peaceful to listen to. However, the waveform analysis fails to show what is happening at individual frequencies 
 and therefore fails to show a broader indication of pitch, which the spectrogram is able to show. Spectrograms shows what time in the sound frequencies are present. 
 It displays the different sound energy levels using dark and light colours. From my spectrograms, it is clear that they all display a mostly light colour which indicates 
 a high energy. This stays consistently over time throughout the music tracks.</p>
