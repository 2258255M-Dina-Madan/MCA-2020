#Basics of Music Data
##Task 2 - Dataset Theme
The theme for my dataset will focus on the famous Indian playback singer, Asha Bhosle. A playback singer records songs for films and actors will lip sync to their
  singing on screen. Bhosle is most well known for this with her singing career beginning at only 10 years old in 1943 and she has sang for over a thousand Bollywood films.
  I have chosen to focus on Bhosle because she has a very disntict voice and her music brings such joy to listen to. Furthermore, her career has spanned over seven 
  decades therefore there is a vast range of archival data available online.

###Task 3 - How is the current data presented, described & analysed
There are many different sources that have curated acoustic, notated & descriptive data on Asha Bhosle.
  
  ####Acoustic Data
  The current accoustic data for Asha Bhosle can be accessed on the <a href="https://archive.org/details/cd_the-rough-guide-to-bollywood-legends-asha_asha-bhosle">
  Internet Archive</a>. The data can be listened to either as a sample, on Spotify or via Youtube. This allows for easy access and can be listened to by all.
  Also, the data is presented as a 'Webamp'. This unique feature allows the user to change the speed and volume of the sound. Users can also save their remix.
  To access the 'Webamp,' click <a href="https://archive.org/details/cd_the-rough-guide-to-bollywood-legends-asha_asha-bhosle?&webamp=1">here</a>. The Interent Archive 
  is a free open content platform. Therefore, with the 'Webamp' feature, it promotes creativity and usability.
  
  ####Notated Data
  An example of notated data that has been curated on Asha Bhosle can be accesed on <a href="https://musescore.com/user/8458661/scores/1939491">Musescore.</a>
  It is presented as a printed score of the instrumental version of 'Janeman Janeman,' sung by Bhosle and recorded for the 2000 Hindi film, 'Kaho Naa Pyar Hai.' 
  Musescore allows digital scores to be readily available for everyone with no license attached to it. Therefore, the sheet music can be downloaded and shared
  for free.
  
  ####Descriptive Data
  Both examples above present descriptive data on Asha Bhosle's music. The Internet Archive presented information such as tracklist, time duration and date of
  publication. This data is useful because it is presenting information on both the music and the source the user is retrieving it from. Next, Musescore analyses
  the data about the music score. It describes the duration, bar and time signature. This descriptive data is key for transcribing music.<p>
